"""Rate limiting (slowapi, in-memory) — the right fit for the single-container /
SQLite deployment; a Redis-backed limiter would be wrong here.

Unauthenticated endpoints (login, setup) are keyed by client IP. Authenticated
hotspots are keyed by the logged-in user (falling back to IP), so one account
can't exhaust everyone's budget. The limiter is created once and registered on
``app.state`` in ``main.py``; tests disable it via ``app.state.limiter.enabled``.

    The bearer branch comes first, matching get_current_user's precedence
    (deps.py). Programmatic clients never carry the login cookie, so without it
    every MCP request fell through to get_remote_address — and MCP tools reach
    the app through httpx.ASGITransport, which stamps each in-process call with
    the same synthetic address, collapsing all MCP callers into one bucket.

    The key is the token's sha256, not its owning user: resolving token -> user
    is a blocking SQLite read and this function runs synchronously on the event
    loop (mcp_auth.BearerAuthMiddleware offloads that same read to a threadpool
    for exactly this reason). Buckets are therefore per token rather than per
    user, and the raw secret never enters the limiter's store.
